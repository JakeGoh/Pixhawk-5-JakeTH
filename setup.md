# Instruction manual to set up a newly flashed Neutis N5
The username and password for the first time log in are username: **root**, password: **root**
After you login, you will be prompted to change your username and password.

The current password in your Neutis is : `rootneutis`

## Add New User
Proceed to add a new user by running the command

Add new user using the `adduser` command
~~~
adduser <name of new user>
~~~
**NOTE**: You can leave the room number , work phone, home phone fields, etc blank.


Use the `usermod` command to add the user to the `sudo` group.
~~~
usermod -aG sudo <username>
~~~
Then switch to the new user using the `su` command
```
su - <username>
```
**NOTE:** After you have switched to the new user, it is impossible to switch back to root user.(Idk why)
if you receive this error :
>sudo must be owned by uid 0 and have the setuid bit 

It means`sudo` was not run with root privileges. The `sudo` binary does not have the correct owner or permissions. It must be owned by the root user and have the Set-user-ID bit set. Then do this:

```
chown root:root /usr/bin/sudo && chmod 4755 /usr/bin/sudo
```
## Connect to WIFI:
Run this command
```
nmtui
```
![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Cmyo5.png)
Press `Activate Connection`and you will see the page above. Select the wifi network you want and enter the password. TADA it is done.

## Using multiple terminals without GUI
use `alt`+ `<any F1 to F12>`to have multiple terminals


##  Install ROS
Follow the instructions on ROS website. Install `ros-kinetic-desktop` version. We use this version because we want the robot-generic libraries.

## Install MAVROS
```
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-mavros ros-kinetic-mavros-extras
```
Then install [GeographicLib](https://geographiclib.sourceforge.io/) datasets by running the `install_geographiclib_datasets.sh` script:
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mavlink/mavros/master/mavros/scripts/install_geographiclib_datasets.sh
./install_geographiclib_datasets.sh
```
##  Use SSH for convenience
Because there is no GUI in Neutis, you are not able to copy and paste commands from websites. A workaround would be to SSH into Neutis from another Ubuntu machine.
### Installation
But first you have to install SSH server in Neutis,
~~~
sudo apt install -y openssh-server
~~~
### SSH
Then you can SSH into Neutis using:
```
ssh {username in Neutis}@{ip address of Neutis}
```
*Example*: `ssh performancerotors@192.168.1.103`

You will be prompted to enter the password.

### Transferring files between client and remote
```
scp <source> <destination>

```

To copy a file from  `B`  to  `A`  while logged into  `B`:

```
scp /path/to/file username@a:/path/to/destination

```

To copy a file from  `B`  to  `A`  while logged into  `A`:

```
scp username@b:/path/to/file /path/to/destination
```
### Cannot set LC_CTYPE to default locale: No such file or directory 
You may encounter errors like this when using SSH
>perl: warning: Setting locale failed.
perl: warning: Please check that your locale settings:
        LANGUAGE = (unset),
        LC_ALL = (unset),
        LC_TIME = "zh_CN.UTF-8",
        LC_MONETARY = "zh_CN.UTF-8",
        LC_ADDRESS = "zh_CN.UTF-8",
        LC_TELEPHONE = "zh_CN.UTF-8",
        LC_NAME = "zh_CN.UTF-8",
        LC_MEASUREMENT = "zh_CN.UTF-8",
        LC_IDENTIFICATION = "zh_CN.UTF-8",
        LC_NUMERIC = "zh_CN.UTF-8",
        LC_PAPER = "zh_CN.UTF-8",
        LANG = "en_US.UTF-8"
        are supported and installed on your system.
perl: warning: Falling back to the standard locale ("C").
locale: Cannot set LC_CTYPE to default locale: No such file or directory
locale: Cannot set LC_MESSAGES to default locale: No such file or directory
locale: Cannot set LC_ALL to default locale: No such file or directory

This is because your SSH client forwards your locale environment variables from your local computer to the remote Linux server which doesnâ€™t have the needed locale generated.

We can fix this by disabling SSH locale environment variable forwarding to fix this error. Open the SSH client configuration file on your local computer.
```
sudo nano /etc/ssh/ssh_config
```
Find this line:
```
SendEnv LANG LC_*
```
Add a `#` sign at the beginning to comment it out. Save and close the file.
## Install screen
When you SSH into Neutis, it is more convenient if you are able to open multiple terminals in the same session. `screen` allows you to do that

Start by installing `screen` in Neutis:
```
sudo apt-get install screen
```
### How to use
After you have SSH -ed into Neutis, enter this command:
```
screen
```
* To open a new shell within the same session, press **Ctrl + A ** followed by **Ctrl+ C**  
* To switch between two windows quickly, use **Ctrl+A** followed by **Ctrl+A** again  
**Ctrl+A, Ctrl+D** will detach from the screen session. 
* You can disconnect from the host and log on again later and use **screen -r** to resume your session.  
* To go to a specific screen window, press **Ctrl+A**  then wait for while and press a number (It won't work if you press Ctrl , A and the number at the same time). Screen will exit when all active windows are closed (or the shells within have exited).

## Install usbutils
You need to install usbutils to be able to use the command `lsusb`
```
sudo apt-get install usbutils
```
## Install usb_cam ROS package & image_common ROS packages
The following driver `usb_cam` is required to operate the logitech c170 webcam:
### Install usb_cam
```
cd catkin_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/ros-drivers/usb_cam.git
catkin build
```
### Install image_common
image-common stack is required for `usb_cam` to run:
```
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-image-common
```
### Testing the package
```
roslaunch usb_cam usb_cam-test.launch
```
**Edit the launch file's `video_device` parameter according to what `/dev/video*` path your camera is using. eg. /dev/video0 or /dev/video1
